# Research Notes: Civic ML Reproducibility Study

## Core Research Hypothesis & Direction

### Primary Literature-Level Hypothesis

**Assumption in Prior Work**: Current academic reproducibility efforts in machine learning operate under the assumption that technical replication by researchers is sufficient to validate scientific claims, particularly in civic technology applications.

**Hypothesis**: *Civic ML systems require domain-contextualized reproducibility validation that integrates community stakeholders, domain experts, and technical practitioners to produce actionable and trustworthy research outcomes.*

### Key Research Questions

1. **Reproducibility Gap**: How does the reproducibility crisis in ML-based science specifically manifest in civic technology applications?

2. **Stakeholder Integration**: What methodologies can effectively integrate community stakeholders into the ML reproducibility validation process?

3. **Domain Contextualization**: How can reproducibility standards be adapted to account for the unique constraints and requirements of civic applications?

### Research Vectoring

**Biggest Risk Dimension**: The assumption that technical reproducibility translates directly to practical civic impact validity.

**Core Uncertainties**:
- Whether community-driven validation produces more actionable insights than academic reproduction
- How to standardize evaluation across diverse civic contexts while maintaining local relevance  
- What constitutes meaningful "reproducibility" for civic stakeholders vs. academic researchers

### Impact Assessment

This research direction addresses fundamental assumptions about reproducibility that span multiple domains:
- **ML Research**: Challenges standard technical-only reproduction practices
- **Civic Technology**: Establishes domain-appropriate validation methodologies
- **Science Policy**: Provides frameworks for community-integrated research validation

## Research Methodology Framework

### Literature-Level Points Identified

1. **Data Leakage Prevalence**: Recent research (2023-2024) identifies data leakage as a pervasive cause of reproducibility failures in ML-based science
2. **Evaluation Complexity**: ML performance evaluation remains "notoriously tricky" with lack of standardization
3. **Context Dependency**: Civic applications have unique stakeholder requirements that traditional academic reproduction doesn't address

### Hypothesis Structure

Following the **∃ X** pattern: "It's now possible to construct a reproducibility validation framework that integrates community stakeholders and produces more actionable civic ML research outcomes."

### Evidence Standards Required

- **Empirical**: Comparative studies showing community-validated vs. academic-only reproduction outcomes
- **Qualitative**: Stakeholder interviews and case studies from civic technology deployments  
- **Systems**: Performance metrics that account for both technical accuracy and civic impact measures
